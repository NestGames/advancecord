A Low-SciFi Game

Advance Cord is a science fiction visual novel aesthetically inspired both by Portal’s test chambers and Alien’s Nostromo. In this, it caters to the theme of total isolation. 

It uses the commercially successful engine, Unity, to tell a story of creation and doubt.

You, the player, will take control of the first fully-operational android in the near future of 203X. 

Sealed away in a testing area, a resonant voice calls out to you. They take you through checks, explaining that you will personally have to build upon your own cognizance - by connecting electronic synapses within hardware that imitates the human brain. This is taught through items you will read and relive within the game. Mementos.

As you study from these mementos, you find yourself growing closer to your creator.
